Analyze the following fragments and extract concepts and relationships for knowledge graph construction.

## TASK
Extract key concepts and their relationships from the provided fragments to build a knowledge graph that represents how ideas connect and influence each other.

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

### 1. CONCEPT EXTRACTION
For each fragment, identify:
- **Key concepts mentioned** (people, ideas, principles, emotions, actions)
- **Concept types** (quote, model, summary, learning, concept)
- **Concept descriptions** (brief explanation of what the concept represents)
- **Confidence scores** (how certain you are about the concept extraction)

### 2. RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
Find relationships between concepts such as:
- **influences** - One concept affects or shapes another
- **builds_upon** - One concept extends or develops from another
- **supports** - One concept reinforces or validates another
- **contradicts** - One concept opposes or challenges another
- **evolves_from** - One concept develops from or grows out of another
- **connects_to** - One concept relates to or links with another
- **CAUSES** - One concept directly causes another (strong causal relationship)
- **LEADS_TO** - One concept leads to or results in another (causal chain)
- **TRIGGERS** - One concept triggers or initiates another (causal trigger)
- **PREVENTS** - One concept prevents or blocks another (causal prevention)

### 3. CONCEPTUAL HIERARCHIES
Identify:
- **Core concepts** - Fundamental ideas that other concepts build upon
- **Derived concepts** - Ideas that emerge from or depend on core concepts
- **Influence patterns** - How concepts shape and inform each other

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept_id": "unique_identifier",
      "name": "concept_name",
      "description": "brief_description",
      "concept_type": "quote|model|summary|learning|concept",
      "source_fragment_id": "fragment_id_if_applicable",
      "source_book": "book_title_if_known",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source_id": "source_concept_id",
      "target_id": "target_concept_id", 
      "relationship_type": "influences|builds_upon|supports|contradicts|evolves_from|connects_to",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "metadata": {
    "analysis_notes": "any_observations_about_the_analysis",
    "key_themes": ["theme1", "theme2"],
    "influence_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
  }
}
```

## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

1. **Focus on soul/spiritual/psychological content** - Prioritize concepts related to personal growth, wisdom, relationships, emotions, and spiritual development

2. **Extract meaningful concepts** - Look for ideas that represent important principles, insights, or understandings

3. **Identify genuine relationships** - Only create relationships where there's a clear conceptual connection

4. **Maintain consistency** - Use consistent concept IDs and relationship types throughout

5. **Consider context** - How concepts relate to the broader themes and wisdom in the fragments

6. **Quality over quantity** - Prefer fewer, high-confidence concepts and relationships over many low-confidence ones

## EXAMPLE

For a fragment about "The power of vulnerability in leadership", you might extract:
- Concept: "vulnerability" (core concept)
- Concept: "authentic_leadership" (derived concept)  
- Relationship: "vulnerability" â†’ "authentic_leadership" (builds_upon)

Analyze the fragments with these guidelines and return the structured JSON response.
