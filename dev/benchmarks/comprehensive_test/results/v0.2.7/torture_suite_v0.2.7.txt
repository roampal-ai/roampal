ROAMPAL MEMORY SYSTEM - TORTURE TEST SUITE
================================================================================

Preparing to stress test the memory system with:
  1. High Volume Stress (1000 memories)
  2. Long-Term Evolution (100 queries)
  3. Adversarial Deduplication (50 similar)
  4. Score Boundary Stress (100 oscillations)
  5. Cross-Collection Competition
  6. Routing Convergence (100 queries)
  7. Promotion Cascade
  8. Memory Bank Capacity (600 items, 500 cap)
  9. Knowledge Graph Integrity
 10. Concurrent Access (5 conversations)

Estimated runtime: 10-15 minutes
