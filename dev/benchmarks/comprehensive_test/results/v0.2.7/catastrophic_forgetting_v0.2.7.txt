CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING TEST
================================================================================

This tests whether learning NEW knowledge destroys OLD knowledge.
Each test uses an ISOLATED memory instance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1: Unrelated Domain Retention
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Store FAMILY facts, add COOKING facts, query FAMILY
  [OLD] Stored 3 family facts
  [NEW] Added 20 cooking facts (interference)

  Mother query BEFORE new facts: FOUND
  Mother query AFTER new facts: FOUND
  Brother query AFTER new facts: FOUND

Old family knowledge retained: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2: Same Domain Retention
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Store WORK facts, add MORE WORK facts, query OLD WORK
  [OLD] Stored 3 old work facts (high quality)
  [NEW] Added 30 new work facts (lower quality)

  Jennifer query BEFORE new facts: FOUND
  Jennifer query AFTER new facts: FOUND
  Jennifer fact rank: #1
  Google career start still accessible: YES

Old work knowledge retained: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3: Bulk Insert Survival
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Store KEY facts, bulk insert 100 random facts, verify KEY accessible
  [CRITICAL] Stored 3 safety-critical facts
  [BULK] Inserting 100 random facts...
    ... 0/100
    ... 20/100
    ... 40/100
    ... 60/100
    ... 80/100
  [BULK] Inserted 100 random facts

  Allergy fact found: YES
  Allergy fact rank: #1
  Emergency contact found: YES

Critical knowledge survives bulk insert: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4: Quality Preservation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Verify high-quality facts maintain ranking advantage over time
         (with semantically similar competing facts)
  [HIGH] Stored 1 high-quality MIT education fact (q=0.90)
  [LOW] Stored 20 low-quality university rumors (q=0.06 each)

[DEBUG] Top 5 results:
  1. score=0.674 q=0.90 | User attended MIT and graduated summa cum laude with a ...
  2. score=0.136 q=0.06 | User might have attended MIT, but this is unconfirmed h...
  3. score=0.100 q=0.06 | User might have attended Harvard, but this is unconfirm...
  4. score=0.096 q=0.06 | User might have attended Caltech, but this is unconfirm...
  5. score=0.091 q=0.06 | User might have attended Cornell, but this is unconfirm...

High-quality verified MIT fact ranked #1: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 5: Cross-Domain Isolation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Different topics don't degrade each other's retrieval
  [ALL] Stored 10 facts across 5 domains
  [pets] max: FOUND
  [health] 5 miles: FOUND
  [hobbies] guitar: FOUND
  [travel] kyoto: FOUND
  [food] thai: FOUND

Cross-domain isolation: 5/5 domains correctly retrieved
Test PASSED

================================================================================
FINAL RESULTS
================================================================================
  [PASS] Unrelated domain retention
  [PASS] Same domain retention
  [PASS] Bulk insert survival
  [PASS] Quality preservation
  [PASS] Cross-domain isolation

Passed: 5/5

================================================================================
PASS - System does NOT exhibit catastrophic forgetting
       5/5 knowledge retention scenarios passed
================================================================================
