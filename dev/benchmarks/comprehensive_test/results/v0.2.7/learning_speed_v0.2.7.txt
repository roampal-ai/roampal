================================================================================
LEARNING SPEED & EFFECTIVENESS BENCHMARK
================================================================================

Measures how quickly and effectively the system learns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1: Cold Start Baseline
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Fresh system with no learning - establish baseline
  [SETUP] Seeded 5 items across books, patterns, memory_bank
  [OK] 'How do I debug Python code?...' -> ['working', 'patterns']
  [OK] 'What IDE does the user prefer?...' -> ['working', 'patterns']
  [OK] 'Explain git branching...' -> ['working', 'patterns']
  [OK] 'What programming languages doe...' -> ['working', 'patterns']
  [OK] 'Python list syntax...' -> ['working', 'patterns']

  Cold Start Routing Accuracy: 5/5 (100%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2: Learning Curve
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Track routing accuracy as feedback accumulates

  Learning Curve (routing 'async Python' to patterns):
  --------------------------------------------------
  0 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  1 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  2 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  3 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  4 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  5 feedback      | #################### | HIT
  15 feedback     | #################### | HIT

  Learning detected: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3: Adaptation Speed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Introduce new pattern, measure interactions to learn
  [SETUP] Created 3 fitness-related memories
  [IMMEDIATE] Routed correctly on first try!

  Adaptation Speed Score: 100/100
  Interactions needed: 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4: Knowledge Retention
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Train, then verify knowledge persists after many operations
  [TRAIN] Established 'database security' pattern (15 worked outcomes)
  [AFTER TRAINING] Routes to patterns: YES
  [NOISE] Adding 50 unrelated operations...
  [AFTER NOISE] Routes to patterns: YES
  [RETENTION] Found 4 relevant concepts in KG

  Knowledge Retention Score: 100/100

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 5: Pattern Recognition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: System should recognize similar queries and reuse successful routes
  [TRAIN] Trained on 3 error-related queries
  [OK] 'ImportError in my Python script...' -> patterns
  [OK] 'Module not found when running Python...' -> patterns
  [OK] 'Python can't find my package...' -> patterns
  [OK] 'Why does Python say no module named X?...' -> patterns

  Pattern Recognition Rate: 4/4 (100%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 6: Context Specialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Different contexts should route to different collections
  [TRAIN] coding context: 3 queries -> patterns
  [TRAIN] personal context: 3 queries -> memory_bank
  [TRAIN] reference context: 3 queries -> books
  [OK] coding: 'Python code improvement tips...' -> patterns
  [OK] personal: 'User's language preference...' -> memory_bank
  [OK] reference: 'What is Rust used for?...' -> books

  Context Specialization Rate: 3/3 (100%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 7: Learning Efficiency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Measure improvement per unit of feedback
  [SETUP] Created React performance pattern (score=0.5)

  Score Progression:
    Initial: 0.50
    Final:   1.00
    Change:  +0.50
    Feedback given: 20
    Efficiency: 0.025 points/feedback
    Thresholds reached: {'0.7': 'fb_1', '0.8': 'fb_2', '0.9': 'fb_3'}

  Learning Efficiency Score: 100/100
