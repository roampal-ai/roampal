COMPREHENSIVE ROAMPAL BENCHMARK
================================================================================

4 CONDITIONS:
  1. RAG Baseline      - Pure vector similarity
  2. Reranker Only     - Cross-encoder, no outcomes
  3. Outcomes Only     - Outcome scores, no reranker
  4. Full Roampal      - Both reranker + outcomes

5 MATURITY LEVELS:
  cold_start  :  0 uses (n/a success)
  early       :  3 uses (2/3 success)
  established :  5 uses (4/5 success)
  proven      : 10 uses (8/10 success)
  mature      : 20 uses (18/20 success)

METRICS: Top-1 Accuracy, MRR, nDCG@5, Token Efficiency

CROSS-DOMAIN HOLDOUT:
  Train domains: {'finance', 'tech', 'health'}
  Test domains:  {'nutrition', 'crypto'}
