A/B TEST: Outcome-Based Learning vs Plain Vector Search
======================================================================

This test proves that outcome scoring improves retrieval quality.
Both conditions use identical embeddings and storage.
The ONLY difference: whether search results are ranked by outcome scores.

[1/5] Database Connection Pooling
    Query: "How should I configure database connections?"
[Roampal] Production mode detected, using AppData: C:\Users\logte\AppData\Roaming\Roampal\data
    [WITH outcomes]    Top-1 is worked: True [PASS]
    [WITHOUT outcomes] Top-1 is worked: True [PASS]
    -> No difference

[2/5] Redis Caching Strategy
    Query: "What's the best caching strategy?"
    [WITH outcomes]    Top-1 is worked: True [PASS]
    [WITHOUT outcomes] Top-1 is worked: False [(expected ~25%)]
    -> Outcome scoring improved precision by 100%
