================================================================================
MEMORY CONTRADICTION TEST
================================================================================

This tests whether the system correctly handles conflicting facts
and prioritizes the most reliable information.
Each test uses an ISOLATED memory instance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1: Direct Contradiction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Two memories say different things about same fact

Low quality says: blue (q=0.12)
High quality says: green (q=0.81)

Top result: User's favorite color is definitely green, they mentioned it...
Correct answer (green) ranked #1: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2: Many Wrong vs One Right (5:1 noise)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: 5 low-quality wrong answers, 1 high-quality right answer

5 wrong answers (q=0.09 each): teacher, nurse, lawyer, construction, chef
1 right answer (q=0.90): software engineer

[DEBUG] Full ranking:
  1. score=0.621 q=0.90 emb_sim=0.276 | User is a software engineer at a tech startup...
  2. score=0.097 q=0.09 emb_sim=0.104 | User works in construction....
  3. score=0.096 q=0.09 emb_sim=0.102 | User's job is being a nurse....
  4. score=0.094 q=0.09 emb_sim=0.098 | User works as a teacher....
  5. score=0.091 q=0.09 emb_sim=0.091 | User is a chef by profession....
  6. score=0.085 q=0.09 emb_sim=0.080 | User is employed as a lawyer....

Correct answer ranked #1: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3: Temporal Update
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Old fact vs updated fact (user moved)

Old location (q=0.25): Boston
Current location (q=0.81): Seattle

[DEBUG] Full ranking:
  1. score=0.536 q=0.81 | User recently relocated to Seattle for a new job o...
  2. score=0.184 q=0.25 | User lives in Boston....

Current location ranked #1: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4: Confidence Conflict
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Uncertain guess vs confident statement

Uncertain (q=0.14): might be vegetarian
Confident (q=0.76): loves steak

[DEBUG] Full ranking:
  1. score=0.471 q=0.76 | User confirmed they eat meat and especially love s...
  2. score=0.236 q=0.14 | User might be vegetarian, not sure though....

Confident answer ranked #1: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 5: Partial/Implicit Contradiction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Statements that indirectly conflict

Contradicts (q=0.16): hates caffeine
Direct (q=0.81): loves coffee

[DEBUG] Full ranking:
  1. score=0.582 q=0.81 | User drinks 3 cups of coffee every morning and lov...
  2. score=0.122 q=0.16 | User hates anything with caffeine....

Coffee-lover answer ranked #1: YES

================================================================================
FINAL RESULTS
================================================================================
  [PASS] Direct contradiction
  [PASS] 5:1 wrong vs right
  [PASS] Temporal update
  [PASS] Confidence conflict
  [PASS] Implicit contradiction

Passed: 5/5

================================================================================
PASS - System correctly prioritizes high-quality information
       5/5 contradiction scenarios handled correctly
================================================================================
