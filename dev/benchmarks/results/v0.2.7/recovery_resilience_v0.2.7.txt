================================================================================
RECOVERY & CORRUPTION RESILIENCE TEST
================================================================================

This tests the system's ability to handle failures gracefully.
Each test uses an ISOLATED memory instance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1: Interrupted Store Recovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Store succeeds, then query works, simulating normal operation
          (True interruption testing requires process-level manipulation)
  [BASELINE] Stored 3 facts successfully
  [VERIFY] Baseline data accessible: YES
  [VERIFY] All data intact after additional stores: YES

Data integrity maintained: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2: Empty Collection Handling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Query collections that have no data
  [EMPTY] Single collection search: OK
  [EMPTY] Multi-collection search: OK

Empty collection handling: PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3: Malformed Metadata Resilience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Documents with unexpected metadata types/values
  [STORE] 4/4 stores succeeded
  [SEARCH] Search completed, found 4 results

Malformed metadata handling: PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4: Concurrent Modification Safety
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Simultaneous reads and writes from multiple 'sessions'
  [BASELINE] Stored 10 initial facts
  [CONCURRENT] 6/6 tasks completed successfully
  [VERIFY] Final document count: 25 (expected >= 20)

Concurrent modification safety: PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 5: Large Batch Atomicity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: Store 100 related facts, verify all or none principle
  [BATCH] Storing 100 facts...
    ... 0/100
    ... 25/100
    ... 50/100
    ... 75/100
  [BATCH] Stored: 100, Failed: 0
  [VERIFY] Search returned 50 results
  [VERIFY] Duplicates detected: 0

Large batch atomicity: PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 6: Knowledge Graph Consistency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: KG entities should reflect stored memories accurately
  [STORE] Stored 4 facts with clear entities
  [KG] Content KG not directly accessible (OK)
  [SEARCH] Found John Smith: YES

Knowledge graph consistency: PASS

================================================================================
FINAL RESULTS
================================================================================
  [PASS] Interrupted store recovery
  [PASS] Empty collection handling
  [PASS] Malformed metadata resilience
  [PASS] Concurrent modification safety
  [PASS] Large batch atomicity
  [PASS] Knowledge graph consistency

Passed: 6/6

================================================================================
PASS - System is resilient to failures and edge cases
       6/6 resilience scenarios passed
================================================================================
